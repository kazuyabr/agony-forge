# The Agony Forge - Demo

**A modern, web based MUD.**

The Agony Forge is a modern, web based MUD core. It is [MIT licensed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scionaltera/agony-forge-demo/master/LICENSE) so you can use it for anything you want, free or commercial.

This demo project uses [Agony Forge Core](https://github.com/scionaltera/agony-forge-core) as a platform to make a modern, web based MUD. It is designed to be forked and customized so you can make your own game without too much coding, unless you're into that.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/scionaltera/agony-forge-core/wiki) for details about how to use the Agony Forge.
